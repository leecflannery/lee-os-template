# Post-Event Debrief

Structured capture after any event. Run this the same day or morning after while it's fresh.

## Trigger Phrases

- "How did the event go?"
- "Debrief on [event name]"
- "Post-event for..."
- `/post-event`

## Steps

### 1. Capture the basics

Ask (or fill from transcript/notes):

| Field | Answer |
|-------|--------|
| **Event** | Which event? |
| **Date** | When did it happen? |
| **Registered** | How many signed up? |
| **Attended** | How many actually showed? |
| **New vs returning** | Rough split -- mostly new faces or regulars? |
| **Venue/room** | Which space? |

### 2. What happened

- **Format recap** -- What was the actual structure? (vs what was planned)
- **Content highlights** -- What topics/demos/discussions got the most energy?
- **Standout moments** -- Anything surprising, funny, or notable?
- **Notable attendees** -- Anyone new worth following up with?

### 3. What worked / what to change

- **Keep doing** -- What should stay the same next time?
- **Change** -- What didn't land or needs adjustment?
- **Try next time** -- New ideas that came up during or after the event?

### 4. Content captured

| Type | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Audio recording | Yes/No | Device, quality |
| Video/photos | Yes/No | Who took them |
| Transcript | Yes/No | From which recording? |
| Attendee contact info | Yes/No | Export source |

### 5. Community signal

- **Who to follow up with** -- Names and why
- **Conversations to continue** -- Threads that started at the event
- **Community health** -- Energy level, vibe, returnee ratio, any concerns

### 6. Asset pipeline

- [ ] What content needs to be produced from this event?
- [ ] Who's responsible for producing it?
- [ ] When does it need to be done?

### 7. Next event implications

- **What to change for next time** -- Format, timing, promotion, logistics
- **Topic/theme ideas** -- What came up that could be a future session?
- **Promotion learnings** -- What drove attendance? What didn't?

## Auto-Route

After capturing, immediately update:

1. **Event file** -- Fill in the post-event section
2. **People files** -- Create/update profiles for notable new attendees
3. **Tasks** -- Create follow-up tasks (outreach, content production, logistics)
4. **Report** -- Summarize what was updated

## Post-Event Ops Checklist

Run within 24 hours. Separate from the debrief -- this is the tactical stuff.

### Comms
- [ ] Send post-event thank you / feedback request
- [ ] Thank co-hosts/collaborators personally

### Capture
- [ ] Process meeting notes / transcript
- [ ] Collect and upload photos/video
- [ ] Export attendee data

### Content Production
- [ ] Identify social media content to produce
- [ ] Decide format + channel for each piece
- [ ] Assign or schedule production

### Network
- [ ] Mine attendee list for potential collaborators or leads
- [ ] Connect with notable attendees
- [ ] Follow up with anyone who expressed specific interest

### System Updates
- [ ] Update event file with post-event data
- [ ] Create/update people files for new contacts
- [ ] Create follow-up tasks

## Guidelines

- Run this the **same day** or **morning after**. After 48 hours, memory degrades fast.
- If there's a transcript, process that first -- more reliable than memory.
- Don't over-polish. Operational capture, not a blog post.
- Bias toward "what to change" over "what went well."
- Always end with: "Anything else from this event that should be captured?"
