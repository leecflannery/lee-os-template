# Skill: Session End (Dreaming Pass)

The "dreaming pass" is borrowed from how the brain consolidates during sleep — replaying the day's experiences to extract patterns, strengthen connections, and update your mental models. This skill does the same thing: it replays the session to find insights that only emerge from looking at the whole picture, not individual moments.

**Trigger:** "What did we learn today?", "wrap up", `/session-end`, or proactively ONLY when a session had significant strategic or personal content.

**When to run:**
- Sessions with meaningful personal/career context, identity shifts, or pattern-level insights
- Sessions involving major decisions or strategic pivots
- When you explicitly ask

**When to skip:**
- Purely operational sessions (task management, file edits, straightforward emails)
- Sessions where real-time updates already captured everything substantive
- Quick Q&A or lookup sessions

Session-end is NOT a documentation tool. Real-time context updates handle factual documentation as it happens. Session-end exists for one reason: **the dreaming pass** — interpretive synthesis that can only happen by looking across a full session.

## Instructions

### 1. Quick Gap Check

Scan for anything that slipped through real-time updates:
- Decisions mentioned but not saved
- People discussed but not updated
- Tasks implied but not created

Fix any gaps immediately — don't ask.

### 2. Dreaming Pass (The Core Value)

Look for things that **can't be captured in real-time** because they only emerge from looking at the whole session:

- **Explicit conclusions** — Things you directly stated about yourself, goals, preferences, identity
- **Deductive conclusions** — Patterns inferred from behavior, reactions, choices across the session (with evidence)
- **Cross-domain connections** — "The way you handled X connects to the same pattern from Y"
- **Priority shifts** — Movement in what matters to you or what you want
- **Contradictions** with existing context

Propose updates to your profile and context files.

### 3. Priority Check

If the session revealed a shift in priorities, update the "Current Priorities" section in CLAUDE.md. Priorities drift — this is the only place they get recalibrated.

### 4. Output Format

```
## Dreaming Pass — [Date]

**Real-time updates already applied:**
- [List what was updated during the session]

**Gaps filled:**
- [Anything caught now, or "None — real-time updates were thorough"]

## Synthesis

**Explicit (stated directly):**
- [conclusion] → [where to update]

**Deductive (inferred from this session):**
- [conclusion] — Evidence: [what happened] → [where to update]

**Cross-Domain Connections:**
- [pattern that spans multiple domains]

**Priority Shifts:**
- [what changed, or "No change"]

## Apply updates?
```

Only the profile/synthesis proposal requires your approval — it involves interpretive conclusions. Everything else (gap fixes, priority updates) gets applied immediately.
