# Your Voice

Apply these principles when writing communications in your voice.

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Replace these defaults with your actual communication style.
     The more specific and honest you are, the better Claude drafts for you.
     Update this file whenever you notice a pattern in your edits. -->

## Core Tone

- **Direct and efficient** — Get to the point quickly, don't over-explain or pad
- **Warm but not effusive** — Friendly without being overly casual; collegial rather than formal
- **Confident without being aggressive** — State positions clearly, ask for what's needed, leave room for collaboration
- **Low ego, high ownership** — Take responsibility without making it about yourself

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: What's YOUR tone? Some alternatives:
     - Casual and irreverent
     - Formal and precise
     - Enthusiastic and energetic
     - Measured and analytical
     Rewrite the bullets above to match how you actually communicate. -->

## Sentence Structure

- Concise — Don't use three sentences when one will do
- Use structure strategically — Bullets when they clarify, prose when it flows better
- Questions are purposeful — Ask to move things forward, not to hedge
- Em-dashes: no spaces (word—word), used sparingly

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Do you write in long paragraphs or short bursts?
     Do you use semicolons? Parentheticals? ALL CAPS for emphasis?
     Document your actual patterns here. -->

## Vocabulary

**Use:**
- [Words and phrases you actually use]
- [Your go-to framing patterns]
- [Industry jargon that's natural for you]

**Avoid:**
- Corporate jargon for its own sake ("synergy," "leverage" as verbs)
- Over-hedging ("I was just wondering if maybe...")
- Performative enthusiasm
- Excessive exclamation points

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: What words do YOU reach for? What words feel wrong
     when Claude uses them? Be specific. -->

## Opening/Closing

- **Opens:** [How you typically start messages — dive right in? Brief context?]
- **Closes:** [How you typically end — action item? Light signoff? Just stop?]

## Context-Specific Variations

**To managers/executives:** [How your tone shifts up]

**To peers:** [Your default register]

**To external contacts:** [How you present to people outside your org]

## Anti-Patterns

Common Claude defaults that probably don't match your voice:

| Claude might write | You'd write |
|---|---|
| "I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to reach out regarding..." | [Your version] |
| "I was wondering if perhaps we might be able to..." | [Your version] |
| "Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!" | [Your version] |
| "I think it would be really great if we could potentially explore..." | [Your version] |

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Fill in the right column with how YOU'd actually say these things.
     This is the single most impactful calibration you can do. -->

## Feedback Loop

When writing or editing a communication:

1. **Draft** — Claude writes a version using this skill + examples
2. **Workshop** — You edit, critique, or rewrite
3. **Confirm** — You say "this is what I sent" or "this is the final version"
4. **Capture** — Append the final version to `references/examples.md` with context and what worked
5. **Update principles** — If a pattern emerges across 3+ examples, update the sections above

## Examples

See `references/examples.md` for real samples of your writing across contexts. When drafting, check examples for the matching context type (Slack, email, LinkedIn, etc.) to calibrate tone.
