# Your Voice — Examples

Real communications you've sent. Used to calibrate tone when drafting.

## How to Use This File

Save examples of your actual writing here. For each example, include:

1. **Context** — Who you wrote to, what channel, what the situation was
2. **What Claude drafted** (if applicable) — The AI's version
3. **What you actually sent** — Your version
4. **What was different** — What you changed and why
5. **Lessons** — What this teaches about your voice

The gap between Claude's draft and your edit is where your voice lives. Over time, this file trains Claude to write like you from the start.
