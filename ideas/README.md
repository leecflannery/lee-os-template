# Ideas

A low-pressure parking lot for things you're thinking about.

No due dates. No commitments. No obligation to act. Just capture the thought before it evaporates.

## How to Use

Drop a markdown file here for any idea, project concept, or half-formed thought. Use whatever format works — a single sentence, a brain dump, a structured spec. The point is capture, not polish.

When an idea graduates to real work, create a task file in `/tasks/` and reference the idea file for context.

When an idea dies, delete the file or move it to an `archive/` subfolder. No guilt.
